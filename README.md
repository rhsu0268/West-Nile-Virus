# West Nile Virus

In disease prevention, ease and quick detection are essential to avoiding a health crisis.  
This is a project that seeks to predict where in Chicago the outbreaks of the West Nile Virus will take place. 
The data is collected by health officials at the Health Department in Chicago. 
Moreover, there are also weather data and GIS (mosquito spraying) data.  

In this project, we will use the weather data to make predictions on where the West Nile Virus will turn up in Chicago, Illinois.
